A lightweight, flexible visual page builder for WordPress. Build stunning layouts directly from the editor.

== Description ==

Blockade is the evolution of the WordPress editor.

Add columns, videos, maps, images and more directly from TinyMCE, without having to deal with a
completely new interface. Blockade gives you the editing experience you're used to, with all the
added bells and whistles of a drag and drop page builder.

Want to know the best part? Your layout is built in clean, easy to edit HTML5, with the popular
Bootstrap framework.  Need to make a change beyond what the interface allows? Simply switch to
text mode and edit the HTML directly.
