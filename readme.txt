Blockade is the WordPress editor done right. It's a lightweight, flexible visual 
page builder that lets you build stunning layouts in seconds.

== Description ==

> Blockade is in public beta. There may be frequent releases and features may change
> as we work towards releasing version 1.0. Please let us know about your experience,
> so we can make Blockade even better.

= Blockade will change the way you look at designing and building for the web =

Page builders are usually overbuilt and hard to learn to use effectively. Blockade
turns that trend on its head, and provides a lightweight page builder that 
integrates directly into your site's existing interface. With Blockade, you can
build beautiful, professional, and standards-compliant responsive layouts, in
seconds.

Want to know the best part? Your layout is built in clean, easy to edit HTML5,
with the popular Bootstrap framework.  Need to make a change beyond what the
interface allows? Simply switch to text mode and edit the HTML directly.

= Built for real designers with real clients =

Real clients have sites with custom metaboxes, shortcodes, widgets, and theme
options built into their editors. Most page builders ignore those crucial controls,
and focus on building a new interface, just for their custom experience. They aren't
good at being a tool that adds to an existing workflow.

We built Blockade to give our clients the WordPress experience they deserve. It
cut its teeth on the real problems users face with designing and editing, and working
with common plugins like ACF and Slider Revolution. It has revolutionized editing
for our team and our clients.

Now we're ready to revolutionize editing for everyone else.
